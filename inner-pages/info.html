                <h1 class="text-primary align-left">Our Loan Process</h1>
                <h3 class="text-primary align-left"><span>1</span> <a href="/inner-pages/loans.html" style="color: var(--primary-orange);"> Loan Application <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></a> </h3>

                <h3 class="align-left">In the application phase, a loan officer will work with you directly to gather all information needed to prequalify your
                loan request. First, you will discuss your plan for the loan proceeds. Are you looking to refinance existing debt? Are
                you looking to acquire an existing business or expand your current operations? If you are buying or expanding, have the
                purchase price details available. The lender will need to understand your business and your plans for the future to
                submit a complete loan application.
                The application includes items such as corporate tax returns and current financial statements as well as your contact
                information, resume and personal tax returns.
                
                Once all the necessary documentation is submitted, Live Oak Bank will send you a loan proposal. After the proposal is
                accepted, you will move into the underwriting stage. </h3>


                <h3 class="text-primary align-left"><span>2</span>  Underwriting Process</h3>
                <h3 class="align-left">In the underwriting phase, you will work directly with the agent assigned to your loan. The underwriter verifies and analyzes documents submitted during the application phase to determine accuracy and creditworthiness. The
                underwriter will complete a cash flow analysis and full review and analysis of other pertinent financial information
                related to both the business and the individual(s) seeking the loan. Additional financial details may need to be
                submitted. Once you provide your signature, you will move into the final stage of
                the loan process.</h3>


                <h3 class="text-primary align-left"> <span>3</span>  Loan Closing</h3>
                <h3 class="align-left">Once a commitment is made by the institution providing financing, the loan closing specialist, or closer, will prepare a
                closing checklist of all required documentation needed on your loan prior to closing. All parties involved in the loan, including the borrower,
                the borrowerâ€™s legal consultants and the lender, will be included on the call. Your closer will then review and approve
                all documents received off the checklist and move the loan into the last phase of closing. At this point, final loan
                documentation, including the Note, Deed of Trust, Security Agreement, is prepared and reviewed by your closing team
                prior to you signing to ensure all necessary information is included.</h3>
